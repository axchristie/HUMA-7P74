Welcome to my website. More coming soon.

## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor in the Centre for Digital Humanities, where I conduct research primarily in the areas of modernist literary studies and the digital humanities, with a particular emphasis on spatial humanities, genetic criticism (textual studies), and digital pedagogy. I am currently completing a book-length study of modernist manuscript practices that informed early electronic editing methods. Recent projects include z-axis research ([http://zaxis.uvic.ca/](http://zaxis.uvic.ca/)) and Pedagogy Toolkit ([http://pedagogy-toolkit.org/](http://pedagogy-toolkit.org/)).
